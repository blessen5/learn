# learn

A lightweight, Git-first engineering knowledge base CLI for DevOps, platform engineers, cloud engineers, and Linux system administrators.

Notes are plain Markdown stored in a Git repository. The binary is a convenience layer — your notes remain fully usable and discoverable without it.

## Usage

See [CLI.md](CLI.md) for detailed usage, examples, and workflows.

## Philosophy

- **Plain Markdown.** Notes are `.md` files. Read them with any editor, viewer, or on GitHub.
- **Git-first.** Version control, sync, and history come free. No proprietary storage.
- **Unix philosophy.** Uses fzf, ripgrep, bat, glow — proven tools, not reinvented wheels.
- **Fast.** No startup lag, no Electron, no runtime dependencies beyond the tools above.
- **Operational runbooks.** Notes are structured for recall, troubleshooting, and reuse — not passive reading.

## Templates

Bundled templates: linux, aws, docker, kubernetes, networking, ctf, troubleshooting, daily, challenge.

All notes get YAML frontmatter with auto-generated tags:

```yaml
---
title: "lsof"
date: 2026-06-08
category: linux
created_at: 2026-06-08T11:07:23+05:30
tags: ["linux", "sysadmin", "cli"]
status: active
---
```

Customize templates at `~/.config/learn/templates/`. Running `learn init` again backs up existing templates before overwriting.
